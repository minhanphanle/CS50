# CS50
This repository contains all Problem Sets and Labs in the CS 50 Introduction to Computer Science course.

Overview: The course starts off with Scratch, a visual programming  language, then transitions to C for 5 weeks, carrying various topics such as algorithms, memory, data structures such as hash table, buggy code and what causes computer to crash. In the last 5 week, David briefly introduced higher-level programming language such as Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript with Flask framework. The course is an excellent pathway for people who are completely newbies and want a bird-eye overview of what computer science is.
