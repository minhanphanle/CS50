Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Predictions with only 10 simulations seems to be incorrect as the top 4 have equal likelihood of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 seems to be good enough as each country has different probability; the ranking is roughly correct while the probability has a different-from-0 one digit after the decimal point.
