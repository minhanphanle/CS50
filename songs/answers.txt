Audio aura: The music is generally upbeat, energetic, and very danceable.
It could be a bit melancholic as valence or positiveness of the album is below average

It would be better if Spotify include number of streams for each song, which would be a weight factor when calculating avg energy, valence, and
danceability. Furthermore, loudness, speechiness, temp, duration, etc. should be factored in.
